### Things to keep in mind

* Concerns
    - Client has no access to objects (Can't write a client that will give you an advantage)
* Not-Concerns
    - Efficiency (Beyond what's necessary)
    - "Correct" solutions (Emphasis on solving problems myself)
    - Account security (Who cares about this game, I don't want people sending me passwords)
    - Compatibility outside of Linux (Not as long as there's little interest in the game)
